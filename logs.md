    Working on the very first prototype website of NDITC.
    A little problem regarding the navbar.
    Can't seem to the distance between logo and menu items. Probably due to using inline-block. This (inline-block property) shouldn't be removed. Find a workaround.
    We can try to add the logo on top then the menu items in the next row, in a center alignment, but that can take much space.
